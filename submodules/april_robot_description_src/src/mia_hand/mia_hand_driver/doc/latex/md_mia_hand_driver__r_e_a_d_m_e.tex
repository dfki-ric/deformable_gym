To be able to use this package, {\bfseries{Lib\+Serial}} library needs to be installed on your device.

This can be done by running {\ttfamily sudo apt install libserial-\/dev}.

If you prefer to install Lib\+Serial from source, please refer to \href{https://libserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html}{\texttt{ Lib\+Serial documentation}}.

This package also depends on {\bfseries{mia\+\_\+hand\+\_\+msgs}} package, so both of them should be cloned in the same catkin workspace.
