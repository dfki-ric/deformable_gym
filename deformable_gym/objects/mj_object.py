    A class representing a physical object in a MuJoCo simulation.
    It provides methods to set the object's pose, get the center of mass, and manage equality constraints.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the object, corresponding to its definition in the XML model.
        model (MjModel): The MuJoCo model object representing the object in the simulation.
        eq_constraints (List[str]): A list of equality constraints associated with this object.
            These constraints are typically used to enforce specific relationships between bodies,
            such as keeping them at a fixed distance or maintaining an orientation.
        eq_constraints_to_disable (List[str | None]): A list of equality constraints that are marked to be disabled for this object
            in a specific occasion such as making the object free to move in the simulation for floating objects.
            This list can be customized by subclasses to define which constraints should be ignored or temporarily disabled during the simulation.
